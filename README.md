# decoding_model_bids_fmri
Repository contains code to run decoding model on fRMI data stored in the BIDS format.
The model reconstructs auditory stimulus representation (Modulation Power Spectrum) from BOLD data using ridge-regression.
For the explananation of the folder structure, preprocessing, data handling and decoding functions see decoding_model_bids_fmri_example.ipynb.
